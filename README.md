# Barracks

## What's it about

Barracks is an alternative programming language to script bots/AIs for Age Of Empires 2 DE.
It aims to provide an additional layer of abstraction compared to regular .per scripting.
The focus is to make it easier to read/write code compared to .per, while staying familiar and intuitive.
Code written in Barracks is automatically compiled down to .per files through the Barracks compiler
